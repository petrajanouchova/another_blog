Inscriptions represent a widely-dispersed body of evidence, preserving messages from communities vanished a long time ago. People of various backgrounds speak to us through the medium of stone, giving voice to their fears, beliefs, and desires, not dissimilar to our feelings today. When studied in large quantities, inscriptions serve as a proxy for the past human behaviour, cultural signalling and as indirect traits of the contemporary social organisation and hierarchy.

Although the epigraphic corpora are published as digital open-source datasets every year, inviting for their quantitative analysis, the scholarship specialises either spatially or chronologically. The overarching study crossing the boundary of time and space has not been attempted, mostly due to the technical difficulties arising from combining multiple digital resources, the size of datasets and the lack of methodological approaches dealing with the specificity of epigraphic data.

I will be posting here my takes on the phenomenon of epigraphic production and its changes over space and time. I intend to approach the spread of epigraphic culture closely interlinked with the socio-political organisation and changing levels of social complexity in hollistic terms, linking the traditional scholarship with modern digital methods.
